## Welcome

I am a machine learning and software engineer, interested in neuroscience, who
loves to dance, sing, and play music.

You are welcome to read one of my [posts](/posts), or check out some
of the things I built under [projects](/projects).

## Scientific goal

I want to discover circuit-level mechanisms in higher-order brain areas.

Approach:

1. Apply an ever-improving machine learning toolbox to large scale activity
   recordings at the level of individual cells to reveal robust patterns;

2. Build software models grounded in the literature that make vague theories
   explicit, predict experimental data, and generate testable hypotheses.



## Education

I have a bachelor's in computer science and electrical engineering, and a 
master's in [biomedical engineering](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/CQ_51360389.htm),
both from [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/).

I took all graduate-level courses offered by the university in neuroscience 
([methods 101](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be//2017/syllabi/e/G0U76AE.htm),
[computation 101](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02B3AE.htm)),
and as many machine learning courses as would fit:

- [ML 101](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02C1AE.htm),
- [ML in practice](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H0T25AE.htm),
- [Bayes & graphical models](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02D2AE.htm),
- [Bio-informatics & more Bayes](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/v/e/H05M9AE.htm),
- [Multivariate & robust statistics](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/v/e/G0O00AE.htm),
- [Nonlinear systems](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/v/e/H0S11AE.htm), and
- [Artificial neural networks](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H03V7BE.htm).
