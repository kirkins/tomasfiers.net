## Welcome

I am a machine learning and software engineer, interested in neuroscience,
dance, and music.

You are welcome to read one of my [posts](/posts), or check out some
of the things I built under [projects](/projects).

## Scientific goal

I want to discover circuit-level mechanisms in higher-order brain areas.

Approach:

1. Apply an ever-improving machine learning toolbox to large scale activity
   recordings at the level of individual cells to reveal robust patterns;

2. Build software models grounded in the literature that make vague theories
   explicit, predict experimental data, and generate testable hypotheses.



## Education

I have a bachelor's in computer science and electrical engineering, and a
[master's](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/CQ_51360389.htm)
in biomedical engineering, both from
[KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/).
I took all graduate-level courses offered by the university in neuroscience 
([methods](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be//2017/syllabi/e/G0U76AE.htm),
[computation](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02B3AE.htm)),
and machine learning

[bio-informatics & more Bayes](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/v/e/H05M9AE.htm),
[multivariate & robust statistics](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/v/e/G0O00AE.htm),
[nonlinear systems](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/v/e/H0S11AE.htm),
and [artificial neural networks](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H03V7BE.htm)).
