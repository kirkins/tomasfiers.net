I have been programming since I was 10. This has lead to a messy heap of hobby
projects, small and large. A selection of the ones I remember:

- Gravity / planetary motion simulator. The generated trajectories were pretty
  to look at. Programmed, as many other projects, in Flash / ActionScript (RIP).
- Fractal tree generator, including a clumsily animated giraffe.
- A [PID controller](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/PID_controller) for a
  two-wheeled balancing robot (like a Segway) made with [Lego Mindstorms](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lego_Mindstorms_NXT).
- A chess AI. Prototype in Python, final optimised code in pure C, using vectorized CPU instructions.
- A Scrabble AI (directly interfacing with the [Wordfeud](https://wordfeud.com/) API).
