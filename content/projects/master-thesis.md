I had the opportunity to do my engineering master's thesis in the lab of [Fabian
Kloosterman](http://www.vib.be/en/research/scientists/Pages/Fabian-Kloosterman-lab.aspx)
at [NERF](http://nerf.be/), where I was introduced to the wonderful world of
neuroscience. The context and the goals of my thesis, and the current results,
are shortly explained in this [conference
abstract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15s-bZM8kam85nFLLU4uAXUC2fgHxB81u75wtEFhqUVA/edit?usp=sharing).
This [poster](/content/Poster-SWR-NERF-retreat.pdf), made at the beginning of
the project, visually shows the setup and the initial plan. I developed a
detection algorithm based on a gated recurrent neural network, yielding a
significant improvement over the state of the art. (For the hippocampus
connoisseurs: [here](/content/Detections.pdf) are some preliminary detection
results. Blue: state of the art method. Magenta: new method).
