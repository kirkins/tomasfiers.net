[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) makes online courses to learn 'data
science' skills, via videos and interactive exercises. (I did my internship
there before the inappropriate behaviour of the CEO, which led to his resignation,
[surfaced](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xzn3v/datacamp-ceo-steps-down-after-sexual-misconduct-allegations-prompt-backlash)).
The DataCamp team wanted to know how long users spend in each exercise,
and to have an internal API available that exposes this data, grouped and sliced
by different dimensions. So that's what I made, with the above high-level
architecture.
