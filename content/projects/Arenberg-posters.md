I did the poster typography and art selection for concerts with my symphony
orchestra at the time (the lovely
[Arenbergorkest](https://www.arenbergorkest.be/en/about/orchestra)). For this
orchestra I engaged myself in different roles: treasurer, IT, second violins
section leader, and president during our [concert tour in China](/content/China-collage.png).
